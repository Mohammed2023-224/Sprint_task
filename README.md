# Objetives:

In this project, I automated some of the complex and hard test cases for an E-commerce website  [https://egyptlaptop.com/](url)

## Tools & frameworks used 

- Eclipse v 4.26

- TestNG  v 7.7.1 

- JAVA   JDK 17

- Log4j  v 3.0.0

## Improvments

- More test cases
- Flakiness of some tests (in the parallel mode) due to the speed of execution and no items in the database
- Headless mode needs more improvements for wait time and screen resolutions
- More appropriate usage of locators.
