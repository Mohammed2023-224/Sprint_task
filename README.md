# Objetives:

In this project I automated some of the complex and hard test caes for an E-commerce website  [https://egyptlaptop.com/](url)

## Tools & frameworks used 

- Eclipse v 4.26

- TestNG  v 7.7.1 

- JAVA   JDK 17

- Log4j  v 3.0.0

## Improvments

- More test cases
- Flakiness of some tests (in the parallel mode)
- Headless mode needs more improvements for wait time and screen resolutions
- More appropriate usage of locators.
